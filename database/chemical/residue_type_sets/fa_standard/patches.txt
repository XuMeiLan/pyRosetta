# Instead of just uncommenting below, consider setting up a CMDLINE_SELECTOR in the patch file,
#  and in your app, put in a line like this after init():
#
#  option[ OptionKeys::chemical::patch_selectors ].push_back( "SHOVE_BB" ); // CMDLINE_SELECTOR in ShoveBB.txt
#
# [or, more cumbersome for users, require a flag like "-patch_selectors SHOVE_BB".]
# That will reduce the generic memory footprint that most apps will see.

##
##Note: The histidine methylated patch is commented out for now, as it was discovered that
##  Rosetta would try to patch HIS_D as well-- which obviously doesn't work
##  since the hydrogen to be removed isn't there. And since there is no variant code
##  added to HIS_D, I have no way of applying a patch to HIS without affecting HIS_D.
##  The added methyl group otherwise works fine.
##
## Note (from rhiju): I added a TAUTOMER property to HIS_D which would allow its exclusion by the path
##  but I didn't implement yet on his_methylated.
